# VKR

VKR is a Vulkan experiment written in Rust to explore [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash) and [rust-gpu](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu).

## Build

Just run `script/build-vkr.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

If you see the following error message but your rustup version is `1.23` already, then uninstall and re-install it following the method suggested on `rustup.rs`.

```
If you see this, run `rustup self update` to get rustup 1.23 or newer.
```
